## üöÄ Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare GitHub Repository

   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Portfolio website ready for deployment"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it `portfolio-website` (or your preferred name)
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-website.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign up/Login with your GitHub account

2. **Import Project**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Import Git Repository"
   - Choose your `portfolio-website` repository
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure Project**:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (should auto-detect)
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-detect)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (should auto-detect)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (should auto-detect)

   - Add any environment variables your app needs
   - For this portfolio, you likely don't need any

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Post-Deployment
1. **Test Your Site**:
   - Visit your deployed URL
   - Test all sections and interactions
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Verify all images load correctly

2. **Update robots.txt**:
   - Edit `public/robots.txt`
   - Replace `your-domain.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel domain

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Fails**:
   - Check the build logs in Vercel
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Verify TypeScript compilation

2. **Images Not Loading**:

### Deployment Strategy:
1. **Development**: Work on feature branches
2. **Testing**: Create pull requests for review
3. **Staging**: Preview deployments for testing
4. **Production**: Merge to main for live deployment
