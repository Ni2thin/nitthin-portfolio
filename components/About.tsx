              I'm Nitthin Kumar, a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology, Coimbatore. I'm deeply intrigued by how machines interpret the visual worldâ€”and I'm exploring this through hands-on computer vision projects and model building.

              I've trained an SSD-based object detection model on a custom dataset, implementing bounding box regression and non-max suppression in TensorFlow. I've also worked with R-CNN on the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset to understand region-based detection pipelines and multi-stage classification.

              For image enhancement, I developed a U-Net autoencoder to colorize black-and-white cartoon images, achieving an SSIM of 0.917006 and an MSE of 0.006378, with performance improved through hyperparameter tuning and custom preprocessing. I also built a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors game using OpenCV and MediaPipe, optimizing gesture classification to ensure responsiveness under dynamic lighting and background noise.
